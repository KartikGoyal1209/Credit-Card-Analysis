## Credit Card Financial Dashboard

### Overview

In this project, we will create two comprehensive dashboards to analyze and monitor credit card operations efficiently and effectively. The dashboards will provide real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

### Dashboards to be Created

1. **Credit Card Customer Report**: This dashboard will focus on customer-related data, providing insights into customer demographics, behaviors, and satisfaction levels.

2. **Credit Card Transaction Report**: This dashboard will present detailed information on credit card transactions, including weekly transaction data, revenue, and other important metrics.

### Data and Filters

- **Data Source**: The project will utilize credit card data, including customer details and transaction details.
- **Weekly Reports**: The data will be organized on a weekly basis, from the first week of January to the last week of December. Each week's data will be available for analysis.
- **Filters**: Various filters will be implemented to allow users to drill down into the data, including:
  - Gender (Male/Female)
  - Income Range
  - Card Type (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
  - Quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Revenue**: The overall revenue generated from credit card operations.
- **Interest Rate**: The total interest generated from credit card transactions.
- **Transaction Count**: The number of transactions made using credit cards.
- **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS)**: The satisfaction level of customers, broken down by gender and card type.
- **Annual Fee**: The annual fee collected from different types of credit cards.

### Charts and Visualizations

- **Tree Map**: Used for filtering data based on various dimensions such as income and card type.
- **Column Charts**: Display revenue comparisons based on different metrics such as customer job, education level, and usage.
- **Revenue vs. Gender**: A weekly level chart showing performance week on week by gender.
- **Top Five States**: Highlighting states with the highest number of credit card customers.

### Design Considerations

- **Color Scheme**: A professional and simple color scheme will be used to ensure readability and focus on key data points. Minimal colors will be applied to avoid distractions and maintain clarity.
- **Template**: The dashboard template will be designed to be reusable and easy to update. Once finalized, it can be refreshed weekly with new data.

### Project Objective
